# Pixel - Decentralized Geo-Location-Based Gaming Powered by API3 QRNG

Welcome to Pixel, your gateway to a captivating decentralized geo-location-based gaming experience. This project seamlessly combines blockchain, generative art NFTs, DeFi, and the innovative power of API3 QRNG to revolutionize gaming.

## Project Overview

Inspired by games like Pok√©mon Go, Pixel lets users explore their surroundings, engaging in thrilling battles with unique pixel characters. What sets it apart? The integration of API3 QRNG for randomness, adding unpredictability and excitement.

### Key Features

- **API3 QRNG Integration:** Pixel leverages API3 QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generation) to provide truly random and unpredictable geo-coordinates for pixel battles. This ensures every gaming session is unique, enhancing strategic gameplay and user engagement.

- **Dynamic Pixel Artwork:** NounsDAO generates dynamic and unique pixel artwork, making each character one-of-a-kind. API3 QRNG complements this by introducing randomness in character encounters, creating a personalized touch for players.

- **Chainlink Automation:** Pixel keeps the gaming environment fresh with Chainlink automation, which generates new coordinates for pixels every 30 minutes. API3 QRNG adds an extra layer of excitement to these random challenges.

- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** The integration of Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) ensures seamless cross-chain trading of pixels. API3 QRNG maintains fairness and unpredictability across different blockchain networks.

- **DeFi Integration:** Pixel incorporates DeFi elements, allowing users to stake their pixel characters and earn rewards. API3 QRNG ensures that the staking rewards are distributed randomly, adding an element of surprise to the DeFi experience.
